# Gesture Controlled Wireless Game Controller


## Challenges:
+ Controlling can be further improvised.
+ To make sure no other signal should interfere with the other TSOP present nearby.

## Progress till date:
+ IR Transmission code is complete.
+ TSOP decoding is complete.
+ Accelerometer interfacing is done.
+ Interfacing with Python is done.
+ Code for Transmitter, Receiver microcontroller is done.
+ Transmission can be done from distance up to 3.5 meters(approx).
+ Asphalt, Star Defender, Motor racing game can be played using these codes.

NOTE: Basic objective of the prototype has been achived. Now this need a 
      little bit of modification to make it as much as user freindly as we can.
